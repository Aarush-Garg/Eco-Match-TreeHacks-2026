The problem: more than 60% of it still comes from fossil fuels, making power generation a global-warming juggernaut. In fact, it's currently the largest single source of global CO₂ emissions. To decarbonize our world, we need to electrify everything possible — from cars to buildings to industry — and power it all with clean energy. This dual challenge is a particularly daunting one: meeting the demands of a growing, electrified world could require us to triple total electricity generation by 2050. That's enough new generation to power New York City 100 times over — every single year. Deployment of large-scale solar and wind is already making strong headway on this challenge.

Traditionally powered by fossil fuels, these plants are now mostly natural gas–based. Clean alternatives, such as hydrogen turbines or carbon capture–equipped peakers, are urgently needed.

Solar efficiency improvements, for example, could reduce required material and land use while maintaining comparable power output. Other examples include innovation in materials, modular design, robotic deployment, and grid integration. By boosting efficiency and capacity factors, we can generate more clean electricity using less land and fewer resources.",

Built in the twentieth century as a one-way street anchored by large, centralized power production, the grid is now straining under an influx of variable renewables and rising demand from electrification and other drivers. The result: gigawatts of clean power stuck in interconnection queues, wind and solar energy wasted, and mounting reliability risks from extreme weather. The fix requires a fundamental rewiring — transforming the grid into a dynamic, multi-directional smart network that can integrate rooftop solar, home batteries, EVs, and more. Because renewables don't provide the same stabilizing inertia as fossil fuels, we also need new grid-forming technologies to keep supply steady and reliable. If we get this right, the grid becomes an enabler rather than a barrier — unlocking terawatts of clean energy, strengthening resilience, and saving billions along the way.",

From farm to fridge to landfill, uneaten food is responsible for roughly 10% of global greenhouse gases, or five times the emissions of the entire aviation sector. It also squanders land, water, energy, and labor. And as food demand rises, so will the climate cost of waste. Here's the core challenge for innovators: It's now cheaper to waste food than to save it. That calculus needs to change. Preventing spoilage and improving logistics must become more profitable than overproducing. The most promising solutions lie in smarter harvesting, advanced preservation technologies, and circular systems that turn waste into value.

What if we could create the essential molecules for our economy, from fuels to fertilizers, directly from water and air using nothing but clean electricity? The quest: make electrolysis so efficient and inexpensive that it outcompetes fossil fuels as the primary pathway for chemical production. This requires a new generation of electrolyzers — ideally built with earth-abundant catalysts, advanced membranes, and high-power-efficiency designs. This breakthrough would unlock electrification of the chemical industry, enabling us to produce vast volumes of low-cost green hydrogen and other foundational chemicals.",

The problem is twofold: most fabrics are plastic-based synthetics made from oil and gas, and the energy-intensive manufacturing process runs mainly on coal. Without a fundamental rethink of how we make our clothes, fashion risks setting one of the most destructive climate trends of our time — but with the right breakthroughs, it could set a new standard for climate progress instead.",

Today's fast fashion industry operates on a linear 'take-make-waste' model, where billions of garments are produced, worn briefly, and discarded, with less than 1% of the material ever recycled into new clothing. The industry needs to be reinvented from scratch by embedding circularity at the very start: the design phase. This means creating garments with modular components and separable fibers that are designed for easy disassembly, repair, and reuse. Design changes must be paired with new business models that encourage reuse, such as scaling up platforms that empower rental, resale, and repair to extend the life of every garment. By combining circular design with a decarbonized supply chain, this approach tackles the industry's massive footprint from every angle.",

The scale is staggering: plants take up hundreds of gigatons of CO₂ each year. The downside? Most of that carbon cycles right back into the atmosphere through decay and respiration, leaving only a tiny fraction stored long-term. But what if we could increase the portion of CO₂ that nature keeps locked away? Innovators are exploring new ways to convert biomass into ultra-stable forms like biochar, lock it away in deep storage, or slow the natural processes that cause decomposition — transforming temporary removal into a durable carbon sink. By amplifying nature's own processes, and prolonging their carbon-storing capacity, we can unlock one of the most readily scalable decarbonization pathways our planet has to offer.",

Nature works on a geologic timescale — far too slow for today's climate deadlines. That's why scientists and startups are racing to accelerate the process: grinding reactive rocks, injecting CO₂ into volcanic formations, even enhancing the ocean's natural buffering capacity to trap carbon in deep-sea materials.

              "description": "Develop low-cost removal of high-global-warming-potential gases. Scalable methods to capture or destroy super pollutants like nitrous oxide or synthetic refrigerants are even further behind methane and CO₂ removal and remain largely undeveloped. This moonshot calls for foundational breakthroughs to make removal possible. That might mean new chemical pathways, catalysts, or technologies we haven't yet imagined. What we do know: solving this could close one of the biggest remaining gaps in climate mitigation.",
